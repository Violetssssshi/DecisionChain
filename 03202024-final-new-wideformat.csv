If the weather was not extreme I decided to not perform as many inspections ,I did not check expiration dates as often as I usually tried to match demand so that expiration became irrelevant.,The hardest decision was deciding how many tests to perform. I noticed early on I was burning through cash through so many inspections but i was able to prevent my defect rate from increasing above 5%,,I decided to be less conservative with my cash and spend more on inspections,Yes i was much less conservative with my cash. I realized the goal was to keep my cash positive and had a better understanding of my costs. On a side note I think this game was much easier than the first because in the first game I had multiple weeks where my product was exposed to high temperatures. During the second game this was much less prevelant. ,$5,$40,$50,,347797.8,318036.3,278405.81,251043.5,248057.83,215751.41999999998,202688.24,197694.62,152780.52,126440.39,127085.22,139034.53999999998,136671.17,138249.7,142157.38,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.752857142857143,4.922857142857143,4.1257142857142854,3.81,4.831428571428572,4.744285714285715,4.228571428571429,3.837142857142857,3.5485714285714285,3.238571428571429,2.9614285714285713,2.75,100.0,100.0,99.38142857142857,89.91714285714285,90.00428571428571,90.5942857142857,92.0657142857143,92.98857142857142,93.75571428571428,94.39428571428572,94.88857142857144,92.49857142857142,92.83142857142856,93.40285714285713,93.85142857142857,2880.0,1800.0,5060.0,550.0,2105.0,3610.0,1685.0,1720.0,5130.0,480.0,0.0,0.0,635.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,Slightly worse than I expected,The dashboard letting me know samples were exposed was a large help. ,I was unable to accurately track when to expect shipments.
